## What
- We have created a webpage for a fictional digital agency featuring us as the developers.

## Why
- A question about why having javascript can cause secuirty issues lead to a random conversaton about cyber security and we then decided to be a cyber security agency.

## How
### Wire Framing
- We started with jotting down some layout and content ideas on paper.

- We decided that we wanted to be mobile first partly because of accessibility issues and to be more progressive.
- all worked on together as a base html structure then pushed to git

### Grid within a Flex-box vs Flex-box within a grid
- We had a bit of a disscussion about the best approach to our desired layout. It turned out that flex-box was the answer to alot of the issues.

### Git Flow
- We fell out of the flow a few times, but we think its great.

### Issues
- We lost 2hrs of work because of git flow issues :(
- We wanted to do more than the time allowed.
- Making the form accessible, responsive and pretty was the biggest accessibility challenge. After struggling with the formatting of the check-box we ended up losing all the work because of gitflow issues.
- used the background property to set the background image of our website though we then realised it would be difficult to manipulate this image as we were unable to apply css styling to it in the way we could if we inserted an image in html
        resolved - taking time-constraints into account we decided to first alter the image on an online editor to the state we would like it to appear and then insert the image as is to our background
- once we fixed the navigation bar we had an issue with the title overlapping the now fixed navigation
     solved - by giving the heading a higher z-index
-Tried to change the size of the nav bar to the destop screen using media query, I tried changing the font size which didn't work.
solved- by using margin on nav ul li.

### What went well
- The borders - they are not a bug!
- coding together is better!
